# Course Aim

The course has two aims. Firstly, you learn how to conceptualize, design and develop your web presence. Depending on your interest and individual technological skill level I propose 3 different options (→ [Developing Your Online Presence](#developing-your-online-presence)):

- Option 1: Minimal But Experimental
- Option 2: Ugh! I hate To Code 
- Option 3: The full deal 

This means, that we will split into different groups to learn the individual tools. However, some basics will stay the same and we will learn them all together. This includes a basic web development workflow:

- Design: How to use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) or something similar to layout a responsive website
- Development: How to use simulate a webserver ([MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)) on your laptop and use code editors ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/))
- Production: How to setup a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name), email and hosting, how to upload your site ([FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)) and how to test it.

The second aim of the course is to learn about digitization in a wider context (→ [Theory and Contextual Knowledge](#theory-and-contextual-knowledge)). This includes looking at how digitization shapes the designer's profession but also how it is connected to topics like ecology, economy, privacy, or ideology. The latest incidents like the climate demonstrations show how important a critical young generation is for our world.

# Developing Your Online Presence

### Option 1: Minimal But Experimental
 
You will program a simple one-page website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Think of this website more like a poster or business card rather than a typical portfolio. Don't include too much content because you will need to update it by hand in the code. Limit yourself and try to find simple, playful concepts. Start with little experiments and be open to surprises. I would at least include your name, mail and what you do. However, feel free to question this as well. Here some possible directions:

### Option 2: Ugh! I hate To Code  

Ok, you don't like to mess around with code but still need a proper portfolio website. That's fine! This is your option then. You will use [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/), a free CMS, and [Laytheme](https://laytheme.com/) for styling the website (my recommendation, feel free to use another theme). The theme is developed to make great portfolios. However, it's an out of the box solution, therefore you have to work with the limitations that the theme brings (which can be a nice challenge after all!). Here are some websites that use lay theme: 

- [https://maxfrischknecht.ch/](https://maxfrischknecht.ch/)
- [https://ja-kob.ch/](https://ja-kob.ch/)
- [http://alexandraschuessler.com/](http://alexandraschuessler.com/)

### Option 3: The full deal 

You want to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth? You came to the right place! You will learn how to use [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/), a clean slick content management system. You will develop a state of the art website from scratch. Everything is possible, basically, the only limit is your willingness to learn and overcome obstacles. Once you handle this challenge you are on a great way to learn other content management systems and at some point take on developer jobs.
