# Course Aims

**[1 Developing Your Online Presence](#developing-your-online-presence)**  
You learn how to conceptualize, design and develop your web presence. Depending on your interest and individual technological skill level 3 different options are proposed. This means, that we will split into different groups to learn the individual tools. However, some basics will stay the same and we will learn them all together. This includes a basic web development workflow:

- Design: How to use Sketch or something similar to layout a contemporary, *responsive* website
- Development: How to simulate a webserver on your laptop and use code editors
- Production: How to setup domain, email and hosting, how to upload and test your site.

**[2 Theory and Contextual Knowledge](#theory-and-contextual-knowledge)**  
Your learn about digitization in a wider context. This includes looking at how digitization shapes the designer's profession but also how it is connected to topics like ecology, economy, privacy, or ideology. The latest incidents like the climate demonstrations show how important a critical young generation is for our world and this also includes critical thinking towards digitization.

# Developing Your Online Presence

There are 3 options porposed to develop your own digital presence. All options will be introduced on the first day and you can pick one.

### Option 1: Minimal But Experimental
 
You will program a simple one-page website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Think of this website more like a poster or business card rather than a typical portfolio. Don't include too much content because you will need to update it by hand in the code. Limit yourself and try to find simple, playful concepts. Start with little experiments and be open to surprises. I would at least include your name, mail and what you do. However, feel free to question this as well. Here some possible directions:

### Option 2: Ugh! I hate To Code  

Ok, you don't like to mess around with code but still need a proper portfolio website. That's fine! This is your option then. You will use [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/), a free CMS, and [Laytheme](https://laytheme.com/) for styling the website (my recommendation, feel free to use another theme). The theme is developed to make great portfolios. However, it's an out of the box solution, therefore you have to work with the limitations that the theme brings (which can be a nice challenge after all!). Here are some websites that use lay theme:

### Option 3: The full deal 

You want to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth? You came to the right place! You will learn how to use [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/), a clean slick content management system. Kirby has is made in a way that the backend is customized for your content and the system doesn't interfere with your design. You will develop a state of the art website from scratch. Everything is possible, basically, the only limit is your willingness to learn and overcome obstacles. Once you handle this challenge you are on a great way to learn other content management systems and at some point take on developer jobs. Some websites made with Kirby:
